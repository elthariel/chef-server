# Veil

Veil is a library for securely creating, storing, and rotating Chef
Server secrets. Prior to Veil, Chef Server secrets we're generated
on the bootstrap backend node and we're long lived for the duration
of the Chef Server install. The secrets generated were completely
random so there was no way to add a new service or credential without
copying the secrets file between each Chef Server in the cluster.
Veil solves this problem by creating a master secret key and salt
which it uses, along with the service name, credential name, and
credential version to create service crendentials. By knowing the
secret key and salt, any Chef Server in the fleet with the given
set of secrets can create the same service credentials without
requiring the the secrets file to be copied.

## Credential Generation

Credentials are generated using:

    sha_512_hmac(
      secure_hash(
        sha_512_hmac(shared_secret + service_name + credential_name + credential_version),
        shared_salt
      )
    )

where

- `sha_512_hmac` is an SHA512 HMAC of the given data.

- `secure_hash` is a secure hashing algorithm such as BCrypt
  or PBKDF2 with their relevant work-factor tunables set very high.

- `shared_secret` is a random 1024 byte secret that is generated at installation
  time.

- `service_name` is the name of the service for which we are generating a
  credential.

- `credential_name` is the name of the credential.

- `credential_version` is an integer starting at 0 that is incremented
  each time the credential is rotated.

- `shared_salt` is a shared secret salt required for the secure hashing algorithm

## Installation Scenarios

### New Installation

For new installations, all credentials will be generated in this
fashion, with the bootstrap node being responsible for creating the
shared_secret and salt.  Generated credentials will be stored in
private-chef-secrets.json in the same legacy format:

    {
      "SERVICE_NAME": {
        "PASS_KEY_NAME": "GENERATED_PASSWORD",
      }
    }

There is also an additional key in the private-chef-secrets.json called 'veil'
that contains the shared secret, shared salt, and metadata for each of
the credentials:

### Existing Installations

For existing installation, a shared_credential will be generated on
the bootstrap node and the user will need to distribute it to the rest
of the nodes on the first upgrade to a version with this feature.

Existing secrets will not be regenerated unless the user explicityly initiates
the regeneration with one of the key rotation commands.

## Credential Rotation

Secrets rotation is still a downtime operation. However, it would only
happen at the explicit request of the user.

## Rotating All Service Credentials

Rotating all over the service credentials will iterate over all credentials,
bump their credential_version, and rehash their password with the new version.

  ```shell
  $: chef-server-ctl rotate-all-credentials
  ...
  All credentials have been rotated!
  Run 'chef-server-ctl rotate-all-credentials' on each Chef Server
  ```

## Individual Credential Rotation

Rotate the service credentials for a single Chef Server subsystem

  ```shell
  $: chef-server-ctl rotate-credentials $SERVICE_NAME
  ...
  All credentials have been rotated!
  Run 'chef-server-ctl rotate-credentials SERVICE_NAME' on each Chef Server
  ```

## Shared Secret Rotation

Regenerating the shared secrets regenerates the shared services, all credentials
and resets their credential_version to 0. In this scenario the user needs to to
redistribute /etc/opscode/private-chef-secrets.json:

  ```shell
  $: chef-server-ctl rotate-shared-secrets
  ...
  The shared secrets and all service credentials have been rotated!
  Please copy /etc/opscode/private-chef-secrets.json to each Chef Server and
  run 'chef-server-ctl reconfigure'
  ```
